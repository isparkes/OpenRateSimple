/**
 * A Record corresponds to a unit of work that is being processed by the
 * pipeline. Records are created in the InputAdapter, pass through the Pipeline,
 * and written out in the OutputAdapter. Any stage of the pipeline my update the
 * record in any way, provided that later stages in the processing and the
 * output adapter know how to treat the record they receive.
 *
 * As an alternative, you may define a less flexible record format as you wish
 * and fill in the fields as required, but this costs performance.
 *
 * Generally, the record should know how to handle the following operations by
 * linking the appropriate method:
 *
 * mapOriginalData() [mandatory] ----------------- Transformation from a flat
 * record as read by the input adapter to a formatted record.
 *
 * unmapOriginalData() [mandatory if you wish to write output files]
 * ------------------- Transformation from a formatted record to a flat record
 * ready for output.
 *
 * getDumpInfo() [optional] ------------- Preparation of the dump equivalent of
 * the formatted record, ready for dumping out to a dump file. The
 * OpenRate.process.Dump module uses this information.
 *
 * In this simple example, we require only to read the "B-Number", and write the
 * "Destination" as a result of this. Because of the simplicity of the example
 * we do not perform a full mapping, we just handle the fields we want directly,
 * which is one of the advantages of the BBPA model (map as much as you want or
 * as little as you have to).
